\chapter{Background}

This chapter sets out define diabetes and the relevant aspects of T1D care enough to understand the content in latter chapters.
It further describes theory of the techniques in the suggested method and reviews related work that should assist putting this thesis into context of the current field.

\textbf{[This chapter is under construction. It should be continued when the method is decided upon.]}

\textbf{Research Suggestions:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item CGM and connection to diabetes
  \item Filtering/smoothing CGM data, what impact does it have?
  \item Meal/Event Detection
  \item Labelling of CGM data
  \item Carbohydrate estimation (Samadi et. al.)
  \item Time series analysis
  \item Time series clustering
  \item Time series labelling
  \item Event evaluation
  \item Supervised/unsupervised problem?
  \item Podova - Logged T1D Trial to test against
  \item Pretrainning?
\end{enumerate}
