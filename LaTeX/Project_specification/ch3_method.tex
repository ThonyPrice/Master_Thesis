\section{Data}

The data is collected by Steady Health during a 4,5 month pilot study including 20 patients.
All patients are at least 18 years old and have been injecting insulin at least 1 year prior to the study.

Each patient are equipped with a CGM sensor for the entirety of the study.
For each patient, the CGM collected BG data at intervals of 1-5 minutes.
Patients will also log other events such as meals and exercise making those values accessible at some of the times steps.

\section{Implementation}

The proposed implementation to achieve X can be overviewed in flowchart [REF].
Each step is more detailedly described in its subsequent section below.
