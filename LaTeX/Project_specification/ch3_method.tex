\section{Data}

The data is collected by Steady Health during a 4,5 month pilot study including 20 patients.
All patients are at least 18 years old and have been injecting insulin at least 1 year prior to the study.

Each patient are equipped with a CGM sensor for the entirety of the study.
For each patient, the CGM collected BG data at intervals of 1-5 minutes.
Patients will also log other events such as meals and exercise making those values accessible at some of the times steps.

\section{Implementation}

The objective of the proposed system is to analyse the data for a closed time interval, identify meaningful events and classify them accordingly.
The analasys is not performed in real time but is considered a batch problem.
The proposed steps of implementation can be overviewed in figure [FIGURE REF].
Each step is described in more detail in its sorrespondent section below.

\subsection{Wavelet Filter}

Studies have data from CGM is subject to distortion.
This is caused by diffusion processes and by time-varying systematic under/overestimations due to calibrations and sensor drifts \parencite{facchinetti2014modeling}.
Noise can trigger false positives in event detection as abrupt fluctuations hidess true underlying derivatives of the curve \parencite{Facchinetti2016}.
Wavelet filters have been used repeatedly with CGM data and proved successful in reducing noise while retaining events such as spikes \parencite{Mag2016}, \parencite{Facchinetti2016}, \parencite{samadi2017}.
Figure \ref{fig:wavelet_example} displays an example of wavelet filtering applied to CGM data.

\subsection{Qualitative Representation}

To identify events in the denoised CGM data feature, extraction is used.
Feature extraction can be acheived by either a qualitative or quantitative method.
The qualitative method offer benefits such as more transparent reasoning and ability to provide explanations for for solutions provided \parencite{Ven2003}.

In qulitative representation by triangular shapes, a CGM data segment can take seven shape variables.
Figure \ref{fig:shapes} shows the different shapes.
Each is a unique combination of the first and second order derivaive on the curve of the current segment.
The derivates can be read from segment adjecent points allowing a CGM data series to be presented as a sequence of shapes describing fluctuations in BG concentration.

\subsection{Event Detection}

With the qualitative representation event detection can be performad by analysing the sequence of shapes.
In figure \ref{fig:curve2shape} an event could be triggered by identifying a continously accelerating increase (4 D's in a row from timestep 12).

\subsection{Intervention Analysis}

Intervention analysis provides a tool to asses how much a given even has changes the series (if at all) \parencite{box2015time}.
The analysis is able to detect 4 patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Permanent constant change to the mean level.
  \item Brief constant change to the mean level.
  \item Gradual increase or decrase to a new mean level.
  \item Initial change followed by gradual return to previous mean level.
\end{enumerate}

Because changes in mean BG concentration are subtle and changes naturally takes place over a longer timespan modifications to the original approach need to be made.
